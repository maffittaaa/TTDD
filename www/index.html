                    At the beginning of the game, each player starts with the same 3 characters!

                    <br />
                    The players can unlock more characters as they progress in the game, gaining XP after each battle.

                    Let us introduce ourselves one at a time:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    My name is Mafalda, I'm 22 years old and I'm studying at IADE University in the Games Development course.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I have a lot of passions but two in particular are the most important ones: dance and videogames!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I always dreamed about making a videogame like WoW (World of Warcraft) because it was my refugee for many
                    years and one of my favourite things to do with my dad!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I hope you enjoy our game as much as we do! 🤩

                    My name is Tomás, I'm 18 years old and I'm also studying at IADE University in the Games Development course.

                    Curiosity for everyone: We are cousins that are crazy enough to make videogames together!
