                    <br />
                    <br />
                    At the beginning of the game, each player starts with the same 3 characters!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As the players play more games, they will gain XP (more XP for winning battles, less for losing
                    battles).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The XP that the players gain, makes them level up. Leveling up is important to unlock better
                    characters and to battle against stronger enemies.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    There are 5 positions in which the characters can be placed, 3 in front for the close-range
                    characters, and 2 in the back for the long-range characters.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Close-range characters can only attack the other close-range characters.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Long-range characters can attack every character.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Each player, during the game, will have access to a deck of cards where there will be 10 cards, with
                    different uses.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The cards can only be picked up one at a time and every 2 turns. The players, after picking the
                    card, can choose to play it or to store it.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If the player chooses to play the card, he needs to verify if it’s a card that gives immediate
                    damage, it can be played but after that, the characters can’t attack.
                    <br />
                    If the card doesn’t give immediate damage, the player can play the card and after, attack with the
                    characters.

                    <br />
                    Let us introduce ourselves one at a time:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    My name is Mafalda, I'm 22 years old and I'm studying at IADE University in the Games Development
                    course.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I have a lot of passions but two in particular are the most important ones: dance and videogames!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I always dreamed about making a videogame like WoW (World of Warcraft) because it was my refugee for
                    many years and one of my favourite things to do with my dad!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I hope you enjoy our game as much as we do! 🤩
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    My name is Tomás, I'm 18 years old and I'm also studying at IADE University in the Games Development
                    course.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I came here because I did a game for a school project in 2023, and I loved it. It started as a joke
                    or
                    just a little idea, but as it evolved, I got more immersed into it and really enjoyed what I did.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In this year at IADE I have learned a lot about games development, and I really feel like coming
                    here was
                    one of the best choices I did in life.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This game has a lot of effort into it, all made by us ( including the art ), and we really hope you
                    like
                    it, because we love it!😁
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Curiosity for everyone: We are cousins that are crazy enough to make videogames together!
